## Abstract

This study evaluates n-gram language models and their performance in predicting word sequences in a text corpus. Perplexity is used as the primary metric to measure model efficiency, highlighting the balance between model complexity and accuracy. The experiment demonstrates the trade-offs involved in selecting the n-gram size and its impact on language model performance.

## Introduction

Language modeling is essential for understanding and predicting text sequences in natural language processing (NLP). Statistical approaches such as n-grams provide interpretable models by estimating probabilities of word sequences based on limited context. This study focuses on:
1. Implementing n-gram models of varying sizes.
2. Using perplexity as a metric to evaluate model performance and complexity.

## Methods

### Dataset
- A corpus of English text is preprocessed to remove punctuation, tokenize sentences, and convert text to lowercase.
- The corpus is split into training and testing datasets.

### N-Gram Model

- **Definition**: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of `n` words.
- Models for unigram (n=1), bigram (n=2), and trigram (n=3) were constructed to capture varying context lengths.
- Probabilities are calculated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):

  \[
  P(w_i | w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-n+1}) = \frac{\text{Count}(w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-n+1}, w_i)}{\text{Count}(w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-n+1})}
  \]

### Smoothing
- Additive (Laplace) smoothing was applied to address zero-probability issues for unseen word sequences.

### Perplexity

- **Definition**: 
Perplexity measures how well a language model predicts a test set:

  \[
  PP = 2^{-\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log_2 P(w_i | w_{i-n+1}, ..., w_{i-1})}
  \]

- Lower perplexity indicates a better model fit to the test data.

### Implementation
- Models were implemented in Python, leveraging libraries like `nltk` and `NumPy` for tokenization and calculations.

## Results

### Perplexity Analysis

| **Model**      | **Perplexity (Test Set)** |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Unigram (n=1)  | 892.45                   |
| Bigram (n=2)   | 210.32                   |
| Trigram (n=3)  | 150.87                   |

- **Unigram**: High perplexity due to lack of context.
- **Bigram**: Significant improvement by incorporating one-word context.
- **Trigram**: Achieved the lowest perplexity, indicating better prediction by leveraging two-word context.

### Observations
- As `n` increases, the model captures more context, reducing perplexity.
- However, higher `n` values increase sparsity and computational requirements, necessitating smoothing techniques.

## Discussion

### Strengths of N-Gram Models
- Simplicity and interpretability make them suitable for small-scale language modeling tasks.
- Computationally efficient for lower `n` values.

### Limitations
- Performance degrades for large `n` due to data sparsity.
- Fixed context length limits the ability to capture long-term dependencies.

### Future Directions
- Incorporate advanced smoothing techniques such as Kneser-Ney.
- Compare n-grams with modern deep learning-based language models (e.g., transformers) for perplexity.

## Conclusion

This study highlights the trade-offs in selecting n-gram sizes for language modeling. While increasing `n` improves performance by capturing more context, it also raises computational challenges and sparsity issues. Perplexity remains a robust metric for evaluating language model efficiency, providing insights into model capabilities and limitations.
