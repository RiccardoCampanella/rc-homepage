## Project Overview

This project focuses on the iterative improvement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, specifically variants of the LeNet-5 model, for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Key Objectives

1. Implement the original LeNet-5 architecture from scratch using PyTorch
2. Develop and evaluate successive variants of LeNet-5, each building upon the previous version
3. Optimize model performance for the FashionMNIST classification task
4. Gain insights into the impact of architectural modifications on CNN performance

## Methodology

1. **Base Implementation**: 
   - Recreate the LeNet-5 architecture using PyTorch

2. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - Design and implement variants of LeNet-5
   - Each variant aims to enhance performance over its predecessor

3. **Training and Validation**:
   - Utilize the FashionMNIST dataset for model training and evaluation

4. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Employ Weights & Biases (wandb) for comprehensive performance monitoring and analysis

5. **Architectural Optimization**:
   - Systematically modify network architecture to improve classification accuracy

## Tools and Technologies

- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- FashionMNIST: Modern benchmark dataset for image classification
- Weights & Biases: Experiment tracking and visualization
