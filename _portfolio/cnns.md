excerpt: "Implementation of the LeNet variants"
collection: portfolio
---

This project focuses on iterative improvements of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures based on the LeNet-5 model for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. 

Key aspects include:
1) Implement LeNet-5 from scratch using PyTorch
2) Create successive variants of LeNet-5, each improving on the previous
3) Train and validate models on FashionMNIST dataset
4) Track performance using Weights & Biases
5) Iteratively enhance classification accuracy through architectural modifications
