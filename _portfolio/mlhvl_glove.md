In this project I implemented a small scale variant of the [Global Vectors for Word Representation]() by Pennigton et al.. I trained the model and performed a simple validation by measuring the similiarty between vectors. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/RiccardoCampanella/MLHVL_Language). This project is part of the course Machine Learning for Human Vision and Laguage at the Utrecht University.
