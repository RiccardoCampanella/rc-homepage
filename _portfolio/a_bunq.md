## AI Agent for Financial Trend Forecasting

---

### Project Overview

The project consists in an intelligent agent built on top of the **bunq API** that transforms raw transaction data into **actionable, year-ahead financial insights**:

- **Trend Prediction:** Using customer transactions, we trained a logistic regression model to forecast personalized rent, salary, and subscription patterns.
- **Contextual Validation:** Our agent performs web searches to compare in-house trends against global market trajectories, ranking and delivering informed expense projections.
- **Data-Driven Discoveries:** We uncovered how deeply insightful banking data can beâ€”especially when enriched with **geolocation data**, sparking conversations on personalization and privacy.
