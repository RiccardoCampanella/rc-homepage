## AI Agent for Financial Trend Forecasting

---

### Project Overview

We just wrapped up an intense 24-hour AI hackathon with **bunq**, and I’m thrilled to share that our team placed in the **Top 3 by popular vote**! 🚀

Over one sleepless day (and plenty of ☕️), we built an intelligent agent on top of the **bunq API** that transforms raw transaction data into **actionable, year-ahead financial insights**:

- **Trend Prediction:** Using customer transactions, we trained a logistic regression model to forecast personalized rent, salary, and subscription patterns.
- **Contextual Validation:** Our agent performs web searches to compare in-house trends against global market trajectories, ranking and delivering informed expense projections.
- **Data-Driven Discoveries:** We uncovered how deeply insightful banking data can be—especially when enriched with **geolocation data**, sparking conversations on personalization and privacy.

As a fun bonus, we added a **meme generator** that turns transaction summaries into tailor-made memes, making financial habits more visible and engaging for younger audiences. 😄📈

Huge thanks to the **bunq tech team** and my amazing teammates: Shang-Jen Wang, Tom Slik, Aryan Omkar Ashar—and of course bunq!
